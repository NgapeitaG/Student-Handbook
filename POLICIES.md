# Appendix: Formal Policies

*These are our formal policies and procedures, which you might need if you encounter a problem or seek a refund during the course. It’s a good idea to read through these policies so that you know the processes we use around applications, admissions, enrolments, fee payments and withdrawals.*

## Definitions of Applicants and Students

### Applicants

Those who submit a registration or communication of interest to Dev Academy about applying to enrol, and/or who submit a formal application to enrol. This includes those who attend Applicant Interviews, regardless of whether an interview results in an application, and regardless of whether they are admitted to the course/s or programme/s to which they apply.

### Currently enrolled students

Those whose records show the following as being completed and/or stored in Dev Academy’s student record-keeping and financial administration systems:

* verified copies of their official name, birth date and citizenship

* a signed copy of the Enrolment Confirmation Declaration (with attached Terms and Conditions)

* confirmation that required course fees have been paid, including any prescribed additional costs or fees

### Previously enrolled students (including Graduates)

Those who have been currently enrolled students in the past but whose student records show them as being: 

* not currently enrolled (inactive); and

* **_Withdrawn_** - i.e. did not start or complete the course/s or programme/s they enrolled on; OR

* a **_Graduate_** - i.e. were previously enrolled, then successfully completed a course/s or programme/s

## Needs assessment and decision support for applicants 

We acknowledge that there are limits to the type of training and assessment Dev Academy can provide. Where we do not have a course or programme that suits an applicant or student’s needs or current capability, we will do our best to refer them to a more suitable provider.

Dev Academy will offer decision-making support to an applicant about what courses or programmes might best suit their needs, interests and current capability. If Dev Academy staff conclude from an Applicant Interview, and/or from other information or communications with an applicant, that they are unlikely to be suitable for, satisfied by, or currently ready to complete the requirements of a course or programme, that feedback will be given to the applicant before they sign any Enrolment Confirmation Form. Dev Academy will provide verbal feedback and answer applicant questions in a genuine effort to help them choose a course or programme that suits their current needs and interests, and that they can be reasonably expected to complete successfully.

## Admission restrictions

To be admitted the student must provide acceptable evidence of meeting the criteria for entry. That is, completing any pre-interview selection requirements, an admissions interview, and being accepted onto the Dev Academy programme.

Applicants are assessed on their:

1. Passion and level of enthusiasm for learning coding

2. Professional, educational or community experience

3. Drive and tenacity to succeed, and find work on graduation

4. Self awareness and ability to relate to others

5. Ability to present themselves to a potential employer

6. Basic numeracy and literacy

The Student Liaison (part of the administration team) is authorised to decide if a Student meets the criteria for entry and therefore authorise that an offer of place should be made to a Student.

EDA may restrict the admission of students based on the following decision criteria:

* Applicants being under the age of 16 (in which case Special Dispensation may be required from the Ministry of Education, and EDA must be convinced of the applicant’s capability to participate in and complete the course)

* Not meeting eligibility criteria prescribed by EDA’s funding contracts (usually TEC);

* Not having completed any prescribed course or programme prerequisites;

* No places being currently available on the desired course or programme;

* EDA’s commitments to attracting and enrolling women, Māori and Pasifika students in the programme.  

## Cross-crediting

We do not offer cross-crediting or credit transfer options. This is detailed in the student prospectus received by students on acceptance. Requirements are only to have basic numeracy and literacy.

## Applicant Interview procedures

Wherever possible and provided by the applicant, EDA will review an applicant’s past transcripts or achievement records, including their NZQA Record of Achievement, to inform assessments of the applicant’s capability and support needs for the course/programme that they are applying for. This will be done in addition to conducting an Applicant Interview.

Potential students are asked to bring relevant documents to their initial interview by whoever makes the first contact with them. These can include:

* At least one form of acceptable identification (e.g. Birth Certificate or Passport), and photographic identification (e.g. Driver’s license)

* CV

* Verification of bank account

Unless otherwise arranged, the interviewer will:

* determine eligibility to enrol on one or many of Dev Academy’s courses or programmes

* discuss and informally assess the applicant’s current capabilities and any support needs; including assessing potential success barriers and likelihoods of being able to complete a particular course or programme successfully

* discuss the applicant’s expectations or reasons for wanting to enrol on a course or programme

* advise the applicant on what Dev Academy scholarships and/or courses and programmes they are likely to be eligible for (e.g. subject to admission restrictions, correct completion of enrolment forms, supply of verified documents, and the attainment of other pending information required)

* ask an applicant whether they understand what Dev Academy is likely to offer them and/or accept as an application, and what is required of them

* provide the applicant with copies of, or refer them to electronic copies of:  eligibility criteria, relevant scholarship and Student Loan eligibility information, and any other standardised information for applicants 

## Identity verification

To be admitted as a student, applicants will be required to produce evidence of their:

* Full legal name; and

* Date of birth, and

* New Zealand birth certificate, certificate of citizenship or passport, or 

* Residency class visa; and

* any other evidence of identity relevant to Ministry of Education requirements; enrolment restrictions; or eligibility for fees, grants, study awards, scholarships or other monetary grants or assistance.

Dev Academy reserves the right to retain a record of this evidence indefinitely for the purposes of validating a student’s identity. Certified evidence of a student’s identity will be recorded and need only be supplied once to Dev Academy.

Verified copies or a sighted copy of the original of **one** of the following types of identity evidence must be provided to Dev Academy by an applicant as part of enrolment and admission requirements:

* The original birth certificate; or

* The relevant pages of a passport; or

* A Certificate of Citizenship; or

Where a student is unable to access any of the above, a whakapapa validated by a Kaumātua, or other culturally recognised person will be accepted.

Where a student has had a change of name since the issue of any document listed in above, and they are using this document as evidence of their identity, the Student must also produce one of the documents specified below to provide evidence of this change of name:

* Marriage Certificate; or

* Dissolution of Marriage Certificate; or

* Statutory Declarations as issued by the Registrar of Births, Deaths, and Marriages;

* Birth Certificate

## False or misleading student information

Dev Academy reserves discretionary rights regarding the failure of any applicant or student to supply adequately verified copies of evidence that confirm identity, citizenship and/or the meeting of any entry or eligibility criteria for courses, programmes, loans, allowances, scholarships or other assistance applied for by the applicant or student.

If any information provided by or for a student (in relation to any type of application, admission or enrolment process that is required by Dev Academy or its course/programme funders), is found to be false or misleading, Dev Academy reserves the right to:

* reject or cancel an application, or cancel an Offer of Study or enrolment process that is partially completed

* **withdraw** a currently enrolled student from a programme or course

* suspend a current student’s enrolment and access to Dev Academy services and premises, until an investigation is completed regarding the suspected or proven false or misleading information concerned, and until a decision is made by the CEO to either withdraw the student or to agree upon actions to be taken to resolve any lack of, or errors in the supplied information or documents.

## Student payment process

Once a student receives an Offer of Place at EDA, they have the opportunity to pay their fees. These are typically due in 2 payments, of $2000 and of the remaining fees. The Admissions team has discretion to offer payment schedules to students in any circumstance. 

Fees are paid into the EDA Public Trust account and students are provided a unique Payment Reference to direct their payment to our account. Our Public Trust account details are:

1. Account Name: Public Trust 

2. Bank and Branch: Bank of New Zealand, North End Branch, Wellington, New Zealand 

3. Bank Account Number: 02-0536-0305865-001 

4. Your payment reference: [unique code for student]

## Payment of Fees

Fees shall include any deposits specified as payable in advance of beginning study at Dev Academy. For Domestic Students, fees must be paid at least seven days prior to the Start Date of Phase 0. Failure to meet these deadlines may result in access being denied to all Dev Academy services. No person shall be deemed to have completed enrolment requirements unless payment of all approved fees has been made and receipted. 

Where a Student has not confirmed Enrolment by payment of fees by the due date for payment, the Head of Teaching and Assessment may, at his/her discretion, cancel the Student’s Enrolment in order to make places available to other Students waiting to take up places. Dev Academy must make it clear in its Offer of Place and Confirmation of Enrolment letters that Enrolments for unpaid Courses may result in the application being withdrawn.

## Variations to Enrolment / Withdrawals - Course, Class or Programme

Students wishing to withdraw from the Programme must provide notification by completing and submitting a Withdrawal Form. Where a Student withdraws from EDA any outstanding fees will be charged in accordance with the refunds policy (see below for more information about refunds).

## Refund of Fees

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Refund Period 1</td>
    <td>Foundations</td>
    <td>Break</td>
    <td>Refund Period 2</td>
    <td>Bootcamp</td>
  </tr>
</table>


We know that joining Dev Academy is a big commitment. Students for whom Dev Academy is not the right place for any reason, or for whom situations change are able to withdraw from all our programmes. 

We offer two Refund Periods: 

1. The first after the start of Foundations (Refund Period 1), 

2. The second one after the start of Bootcamp (Refund Period 2). 

3. You are able to withdraw within eight days of Foundations starting, and within five days of Bootcamp starting.

If we have it in writing that you have withdrawn from the course before the end of the eighth day for Foundations, or the end of the fifth day for Bootcamp, EDA shall refund the amount held on behalf the student, with a deduction of the following costs : $200 if you withdraw within the refund period for Foundations, and  $2,000 (the cost of Foundations) if you withdraw within the refund period for Bootcamp. 

For withdrawal from day nine onwards in Foundations, and day six onwards in Bootcamp, there will be no refund of tuition fees. In special circumstances EDA reserves the right to offer refunds to students in the course (such as serious illness, etc), and this is decided on a case-by-case basis.

The effective date for processing of any withdrawal or any request for refund will be the date the fully completed Refund Application Form is received in writing.

EDA reserves the right to terminate a Student’s training at any time and provide a tuition refund.

The CEO is authorised within the limits of their financial delegated authority to approve refunds for Students on a compassionate basis in exceptional circumstances (such as serious illness, etc.) The amount of the refund will be at their discretion.

## Responsibility for enrolment and fee payment decisions

Final responsibility for application and enrolment decisions rests with applicants and students. EDA is not responsible for enrolment decisions, including course or programme choices made by students, nor for any decisions to accept and pay any fees required to enrol. EDA is not responsible for applicants’ or students’ personal choices to access a Student Loan, Student Allowance, or to access any other loans or allowances made available to them by Studylink, other government agencies, or by personal lenders in order to be able to pay required course fees and related costs.

## Cancellation of courses or programmes by Dev Academy

If there are changes to the timetable (or cohort start date) of a course in which a student is enrolled, EDA will endeavour to provide an alternative that meets the student’s requirements or will cancel the student’s enrolment and fully refund any fees paid by the student.

In the event of a course cessation or voluntary closure situation (unforeseeable circumstances beyond EDA’s control) causing suspension of Classes for an indefinite period of time, EDA will follow the Student Fee Protection policy detailed below.

## Student Conduct while at Dev Academy

### Intent

Dev Academy works with employers, in line with industry best practice, to ensure that students adhere to strict standards of behaviour and professional conduct during their training programme. Dev Academy provides guidance and support to students, but if standards of behaviour, course participation or performance are not satisfactory, the organisation will act to either correct the behaviour or remove the student from the programme.

If a student’s actions are considered by the CEO to be serious misconduct, including but not limited to: assault, intimidation, causing serious damage to property, theft or supplying illegal drugs, the student will be removed from the programme without warning.

### Verbal warnings

Students are expected to commit to the core values of Integrity, Kindness and Effort. They are expected to display their commitment to these values through their actions and behaviour. If it is believed a student is not displaying behaviour that is aligned with these values, the teacher should discuss the specific aspects of the student’s behaviour, performance or attendance that are causing concern.

If there is no significant improvement over time, a verbal warning should be given, reminding them of the changes they need to make. The teacher should record the time, place and reasons for the warning.

### Written warnings

A written warning should only be given after at least two verbal warnings have been given and documented. It should:

* specify what behaviours, attitudes and/or achievement levels are unacceptable;

* set verifiable targets and deadlines for improvement;

* include what actions the student needs to take to rectify the behaviour, attitude or achievement level;

* include the words "if you do not meet these requirements you will be removed from the course"; and

* if the person is on a benefit, a warning about possible loss of benefit should be included.

Where possible, students should be interviewed and have the contents of warning letters explained to them. 

The CEO must be consulted before a written warning is issued.

### Removal

Removal from a course will occur when:

* a student is being summarily removed as a result of a serious act or omission; or

* they have consistently failed to comply with requests made of them through the verbal and written warning process.

## Student Attendance and Absences

Students are required to report absences in advance when they know they will be absent. 

When a student has stopped attending class(es), all reasonable efforts will be made to contact the student to determine whether they have formally withdrawn. Dev Academy will also ask the student whether Dev Academy can provide any particular pastoral support or assistance to enable them to attend regularly again and progress with their studies. 

Withdrawal of a student will not be approved on the grounds of inadequate attendance without there having been:

* **at least three attempts** made by staff to contact the student, and

* **at least one attempt** to offer the student pastoral support or other assistance, and

Dev Academy will consider a student’s attendance history, and any personal issues or circumstances beyond the student’s control that the student is willing to disclose, as part of decision-making about:

* whether to withdraw a student from a course or programme; 

* whether and what special allowances will be made for a non-attending student to remain enrolled, and with what timeframes or conditions applied; and 

* whether to continue attempting to make contact with an absent student, and whether and what forms of pastoral support or other assistance to offer them.

The CEO must approve the withdrawal of a student from any courses or programmes, after staff have made sufficient unsuccessful attempts to contact and re-engage the student; and/or after a student makes contact but then refuses to or fails to comply with minimum attendance requirements. 

Before a decision to withdraw the student will be considered, a contact log of communication attempts between the student and Dev Academy staff must be documented and attached to their student records. It must show that the student was offered pastoral support or other assistance to help them overcome any personal or practical attendance barriers. It must also show that the student refused or was unable to provide satisfactory explanations for their repeated absence. 

## Student Complaints

### General principles

* Complaints must be dealt with in a sensitive and confidential manner. There may be times when we will need to discuss the issues with the person against whom the complaint is directed in order to help achieve a resolution. If so, this course of action should be discussed with the complainant and agreement should be secured before proceeding.

* Problems should be dealt with as close to the source as possible. They should be referred to a higher level only after attempts to resolve them at the lower level have failed.

* If a complaint is about another person, that person must be given an opportunity to respond to the complaint that was made about them. Any person being complained about is regarded as having as much right to a fair hearing as the person making the complaint. Both sides should be heard without prejudice before any further action is taken.

* A focus on problem solving and conflict resolution will be applied as a standard response, rather than focusing on laying blame. However, Dev Academy will apply disciplinary action in cases where it becomes necessary to do so; including in cases where serious misconduct was involved.

### Informal complaints

Examples of informal complaints might include the following:

* minor classroom irritations (other students break concentration by always talking in class, teacher fails to keep order)

* concerns arising from miscommunication or misunderstanding

* minor disagreements over academic matters, resource issues

* facilities issues.

Informal complaints are usually made verbally to a staff member, who should interview the person in private, allowing a support person to attend if requested. A teacher will evaluate the nature and seriousness of the complaint, resolve it at the time if possible, or refer it on to the CEO. If the complaint is about one or more other staff, students or other people who are frequently present at the campus, those people should initially be interviewed separately. 

Any staff member who initially responds to or receives a complaint may choose to seek advice or involvement from another staff member, particularly if another staff member’s role or actions are relevant to the complaint issue and/or if the student specifically requests another staff member’s involvement in the process. The staff member who initially responds to or receives a complaint should use their discretion to judge whether it is necessary to refer the complaint to another more senior staff member to:

* have input into achieving a remedy or resolution, and/or 

* take over the handling of the complaint, and/or

* manage any conflict of interest or bias that may be real, or perceived as existing between the student and the initial responder.

A *resolution* or *remedy* to a complaint is deemed to have been achieved when the complainant agrees that a resolution or remedy has been achieved, and accordingly confirms that they accept that no further action will be taken in response to their complaint. 

If a student does not agree that a resolution or remedy has been achieved, after steps have been taken by relevant Dev Academy staff to address their complaint, the student then has the option to complain to an outside authority; at which point the complaint will be treated as a **Formal Complaint**.

### Formal Complaints

Anyone wishing to make a Formal Complaint will be advised that they must submit their complaint in writing; that they have the right to bring a support person to meetings regarding their complaint; and they will be referred to the CEO who will attempt to resolve the issue.

A written record will be kept in a central filing system detailing:

* what the complaint was, and any background or context details of significance

* any meeting/s that were held (when, where, with who), or other correspondence that happened as part of attempts to discuss or respond to the complaint

* an account of whatever steps were taken to achieve a resolution

* an **Outcome Statement** (i.e. a statement about whether and what remedy/resolution was agreed upon, or whether a remedy/resolution was not agreed upon, and what is expected to happen next)

The CEO will produce and/or sign the Outcome Statement to verify that they are aware of it. The Statement should be signed by the student who made the complaint; the CEO; the staff member who led the last steps of handling the complaint (if it was not the CEO); and any other affected parties.

If a student who made a complaint is not satisfied with the outcome from the complaint handling process (as summarised in the Outcome Statement), they will be advised of their right to go to an appropriate **external authority**.

### Confidentiality

The disputes process, and any information collected during it, is confidential. If a party to the dispute chooses to invalidate the complaints process by discussing the complaint outside of this process, the protection of their confidentiality will be considered redundant.

## Alcohol and Other Drugs

### Context

Drug and alcohol abuse by students affects other students, staff and the organisation as a whole. The most significant effects are: 

* when a student is abusing drugs or alcohol their academic performance will be impaired

* when a student is abusing drugs or alcohol they pose a health and safety risk to other students and staff

* students who are using drugs can negatively influence other students, causing drug or alcohol abuse to increase among students

* students that are abusing drugs or alcohol take valuable teacher time away from other students

* if alcohol or drug abuse becomes common practice among students this may influence the public perception of Dev Academy as a quality training provider

* if students escalate to selling drugs from Dev Academy-controlled premises the organisation could be at significant legal liability.

### Procedures

The following procedure will be followed when there is a consistent pattern of students performance on the course dropping and/or poor performance and the suspected reason is alcohol or drug use:

### Concern by member of staff

If a member of staff is concerned about a student’s performance on the course and they suspect that the reason for impaired performance is related to alcohol or drug use they should report this concern to the CEO. A list of reasonable grounds for suspicion includes but is not limited to a sustained pattern of:

1. Lack of focus or concentration

2. Lack of energy or motivation

3. Lateness or absence

4. Significant personality change

5. Irritability

6. Forgetfulness

7. Declining or poor performance 

### Action by CEO

The CEO will:

1. Speak with team members involved with the student to gather observed evidence. This must be done in a way that does not compromise the confidentiality of the student.

2. Review the student’s performance including:

    1. Attendance

    2. Academic performance

    3. Training pathway

    4. Teacher observations

    5. Any other information they consider relevant

3. Seek advice as required

4. Interview the student to decide whether the conduct of the student is of significant magnitude to review the student’s status on the course. They will assess the level of alcohol or drug use by the student and how it is impacting their performance on the course.

There are three options for recommendations concerning the student’s status:

**1. No change**

There is not a case for further action. The student is either not using drugs or their performance problems are not alcohol or drug related. **Action**: No further action will be taken. The member of staff who raised the concern will be informed.

**2. Conditional retention**

If the student is cooperative and open to additional support, the student will benefit from additional support from the Human SKills Teacher to develop and coordinate the student’s support plan. The student’s retention on the course is conditional on their cooperation with the support plan. **Action**: Referred to Human Skills Teacher to develop support plan. Conditional retention noted on student’s file. 

**3. Dismissal**

If the CEO concludes the student’s conduct is sufficiently disruptive they will be dealt with as per the existing policy STU 7.0 - Student Conduct (parts of which are detailed below). If the student is selling drugs from the Dev Academy premises the matter will be referred to the police.**Action**: CEO acts as per the existing policy STU 7.0 or refers matter to the police.

## Support plan

The Human Skills Teacher that develops and coordinates the student’s support plan will meet with the student and conduct a holistic assessment to identify what barriers exist to the student achieving their full potential while at Dev Academy.

The support plan should be developed collaboratively with the student. The plan should augment and reinforce the student’s career or training pathway. 

The focus of the plan is not for the Human Skills teacher to provide counselling to the student. Where possible the Human Skills teacher should refer to external agencies.

The Human Skills teacher will then meet with the student and the student’s lead teacher fortnightly to review progress. The Human Skills teacher will give regular feedback to the CEO about the student’s progress.

### Confidentiality

The team member charged with developing and coordinating the student’s support plan will keep all information learnt during the development of the support plan and the review of the plan confidential unless they believe the student:

* Is in danger of harming themselves

* Is in danger of harming someone else

* Is supplying drugs to other students 

## Trespass

### Procedures

The decision to trespass someone from a property operated by Dev Academy is a significant one. This decision should only be taken after consultation with the CEO.

Once the decision to trespass someone has been made, the Space Manager (who is the person charged with managing the premises) or the most senior member of staff present will coordinate this procedure:

* All students who are willing and able to be moved should be moved immediately to a secure area away from the person. Ideally a member of staff should remain with the students until the threat has been mitigated.

* The senior member of staff, ideally supported by at least one other team member should speak to the person. They should warn them that their behaviour is inappropriate and ask them to leave the premises.

* If the person/s does not leave after at least three times of asking, the team member should advise them that as the occupier, s/he is trespassing them from the premises (under section 3 of the Trespass Act 1980) and will contact the police to have them removed.

* If they will still not leave the premises, the police are to be called to serve a written trespass notice on them (for this to be arranged, you will need their name and address).
